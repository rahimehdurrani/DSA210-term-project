# DSA210-term-project
## Project Overview
This project aims to look at the relationship between literacy rates and gender equality. Gender equality, measured by the Women’s  Security and Peace Index, alongside the Gini Co-efficient, a measure of economic inequality, will be used to understand how education and economic factors interact to impact gender equality. 

## Motivation 
When we see countries today prosper economically, we see thaat their success can be linked to high literacy rates. However, in 2025, despite economic prosperity, gender discrimination is still quite prevalent. Thus, in my project, I intend to:
1. Investigate whether higher literacy rates can be linked to better gender equality
2. Whether economic inequality is negatively correlated with literacy rate, and how that impacts our measure of gender equality


## Data Sources
The data sets that I intend on using my project have all been taken from data that has been made publically available.
1. Global Literacy Rates: This data set has been taken from the World Bank website and provides the percentage of people aged 15 and above who count as literate.
2. Women's Peace and Security Index: This data set has been taken from the Georgetown Instituite for Women, Peace and Security, and will be acting as our measure of gender equality
3. Gini-Coefficient: The Gini-coefficent will be our measure of economic inequality, whose dataset has also been taken from the World Bank's website.

## Data Analysis Plan:

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing:
   a. Handle missing data through imputation or exclusion, depending on the extent of missingness.
   b. Merge the three datasets using country as the common value.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   a. Conduct descriptive statistics to summarize the data (e.g., mean, median etc).
   b. Visualize relationships between variables using scatterplots, histograms, 
   c. Identify outliers and understand their impact on the analysis.

3. Correlation Analysis:
   a. Understand whether lower literact rates can be correlated with poor gender equality and a low gini-coefficient.

4. Visualization:
   a. Visualize my findings using graphs such as scatter plots and bar graphs to summarise and better understand my findings.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I  want to determine if there’s a correlation between adult literacy rates and gender equality (Women's Security and Peace Index) and explore how economic inequality (Gini coefficient) influences these relationships. Moreover, look at other sidelined relationships such as ones pertaining to region, i.e: developing vs developed countries. Lastly, see whether regardless of literacy rates, does gender inequality still persist to the level that it does
